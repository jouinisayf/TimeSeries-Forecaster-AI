It explains how to install dependencies, run the forecasting pipeline, and understand the results. 1. Introduction TimeSeries-Forecaster-AI is a lightweight time-series forecasting pipeline that combines: ARIMA models (to capture temporal structure) GARCH models (to model volatility) Poetry for dependency management Logging , unit tests , and documentation This tutorial explains how to execute the project from end to end. 2. Requirements Before running the project, you need: Python 3.10 or above Poetry installed: pip install poetry 3. Install Dependencies From the project root directory: poetry install This installs all dependencies specified in the pyproject.toml file: pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels arch logging tools pytest (dev) ruff (dev) pdoc (dev) 4. Run the Forecasting Pipeline The main script is located here: src/main.py To run the full ARIMA + GARCH pipeline: poetry run python src/main.py The pipeline performs the following steps: -Loads the dataset data/gld_price_data.csv -Cleans missing values -Fits an ARIMA(2,0,3) model -Fits a GARCH(1,1) model on ARIMA residuals -Forecasts the next 20 values -Displays: ARIMA summary GARCH summary *Forecast plot (Matplotlib) 5. Example Output You should see something like: ARIMA Summary: SARIMAX Results ... GARCH Summary: Volatility Model: GARCH(1,1) ... A Matplotlib graph will also appear showing the historical series and the forecast. 6. Understanding the Plot The generated plot contains: Blue line \u2192 original historical GLD values Red line \u2192 ARIMA forecast for the next 20 steps This helps visualize trend continuation and volatility influence. 7. Running Tests To run unit tests: poetry run pytest -v Expected output: test_preprocess.py .... PASSED test_models.py .... PASSED 8. Generate Documentation Documentation can be generated using pdoc: poetry run pdoc src -o docs Generated HTML files will appear inside: docs/ 9. Conclusion You are now ready to explore, modify, or extend the ARIMA + GARCH forecasting tool. Feel free to adapt the models, test different parameters, or analyze new datasets.
